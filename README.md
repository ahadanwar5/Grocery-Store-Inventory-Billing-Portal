# Grocery Store Management System

## Abstract
The Grocery Store Management System is a solution designed to automate and centralize the operations of a supermarket. It replaces the traditional manual record-keeping methods with a user-friendly interface to manage inventory, sales, customer records, and employee information. By transitioning to this system, the business aims to save time, reduce paperwork, and minimize human error.

## Domain Description
### Business Description
Samarqand Store is a family-owned general store located in Main Bazar, Nishat, Lahore Cantt. The store offers a range of grocery items to its customers and employs three workers along with a cashier (owner). Two types of customers are served: walk-in customers and credit customers.

### Current Situation
The store currently lacks a point-of-sale (POS) system to track sales in real-time. Only credit sales are recorded manually, leading to errors and discrepancies. Managing inventory and customer credit records is challenging due to limited space in credit books and the absence of an invoicing system.

## Requirement Specification
The system aims to automate sales, inventory management, and payroll processing. Functional requirements include managing products, employees, customers, orders, payments, and suppliers. Non-functional requirements focus on user-friendliness, security, and report comprehensibility.

## Assumptions
- The business accepts only cash payments.
- Walk-in customers pay in full at the time of purchase.
- Incoming items from suppliers are stocked on the same day.
- Item and order returns are managed manually.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) - Refer to Documentation
The ERD illustrates the structure of the system, including entities such as customers, orders, products, suppliers, and employees, along with their attributes and relationships.

## Screen Shots - Refer to Documentation
Screenshots of the developed frontend and reports provide a visual representation of the system's user interface and reporting capabilities.

## Normalization to 3rd NF - Refer to Documentation
Normalization ensures data integrity by organizing data into separate tables and eliminating data redundancies. The system's tables are normalized up to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to minimize data duplication and dependency issues.

## Denormalization Opportunities - Refer to Documentation
Opportunities for denormalization are explored to optimize data retrieval and improve system performance.

## Conclusion
The Grocery Store Management System offers a comprehensive solution to automate supermarket operations. By implementing this system, the business can streamline processes, enhance productivity, and provide better customer service.

## Recommendations
To further improve the system, recommendations include transitioning to a centralized web-based platform, integrating online ordering and payment systems, and enhancing security measures to protect sensitive data.
